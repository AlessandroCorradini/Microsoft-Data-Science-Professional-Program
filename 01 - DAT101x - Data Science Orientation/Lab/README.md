# Lab
### Lab: Exploring Data

In this lab, you'll have a chance to put some of the principles and techniques you've seen in the course into practice. To complete the lab:

1.  Ensure you have the necessary software. You need a Windows PC or a Mac, with Microsoft Excel 2016 installed. If you don't have Excel 2016, you can sign up for a free trial of Microsoft Office 365 at [http://aka.ms/edx-dat101x-o365](https://aka.ms/openedx-dat101x-o365) and install the Office applications.
2.  Download and extract the lab files for this course from [dat101x-labs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/Data-Science-Orientation/master/Labs/DAT101x_Labfiles.zip).
3.  Follow the instructions in the lab document, which you can download from [dat101x-labdoc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/Data-Science-Orientation/master/Labs/DAT101x%20Lab%20-%20Exploring%20Data.pdf).
4.  Answer the verification questions below. You can attempt each question only twice, so make sure you've performed the tasks in the lab carefully before answering!

This assessment is ungraded, but you should use it to test your basic skills in working with data in Excel. Later courses in the curriculum include labs with assessments like this that are graded, and in which you may be restricted to only one attempt per question; so use this lab as practice, and try to the questions carefully and answer correctly in as few attempts as possible.

_If you have any questions about grading or specific questions, please post them in the course discussion forum. However, please avoid posting any information that will reveal answers to your fellow students. In the event of a dispute, the decision of the course staff is final._
