Please answer the following questions. Be sure that you have downloaded the associated Excel file before beginning the homework. This lesson uses the BayesHW.xlsx file and has five problems.

Remember that homework counts for 10% of your final grade. You are allowed unlimited attempts per question for homework problems. The main goal of homework is for you to practice and learn how to apply what you've learned in the content without worrying about getting the problem right the first time. Some homework problems may also provide hints or advice. Have fun!

### Bayes1

A company has a plant in Houston and Dallas. 70% of the employees work in Houston and 30% work in Dallas. Each year 3% of the Houston employees are involved in an accident and 5% of the Dallas employees are involved in an accident.

If you randomly choose an employee who had an accident last year, what is the chance they work in Houston?

- 0.21
- **0.58**
- 0.15
- 0.44

### Bayes2

A chest has two drawers. Each drawer contains two coins and you know one drawer has 2 gold coins and the other drawer has one gold and one silver coin. You randomly pick a drawer and a coin and the selected coin is gold.

What is the chance that the other coin in the drawer is gold?

- **2/3**
- 1/2
- 3/4
- 1/1

### Bayes3

80% of an insurance companyâ€™s policyholders are high risk and 20% are low risk. Assume nobody has more than one accident in a year. Also assume 10% of high risk people have an accident during a year and 3% of low risk people have an accident during a year.

If you randomly choose a policyholder who had an accident last year, what is the chance they are a high risk policyholder?

- 0.89
- 0.7
- 0.67
- **0.93**

### Bayes4

Assume 1 in every 1000 people are liars. Also suppose a lie detector test is 98% accurate. That is, if a person is lying there is a 98% chance the test will indicate that they are lying. Also, if the person is not lying, there is a 98% chance the test will indicate the person is not lying.

If the lie detector test indicates the person is lying, what is the chance the person is lying?

- **0.05**
- 0.98
- 0.20
- 0.02

### Bayes5

85% of all cabs are blue and the rest are green. A cab identified in a hit and run accident is identified as green. People can correctly identify the color of a cab 80% of the time. When surveyed, most Stanford students thought there was an 80% chance the cab is actually green.

Do you agree?

- Yes
- **No**

What is the chance that the cab is actually green?

- 0.80
- **0.41**
- 0.15
- 0.52
