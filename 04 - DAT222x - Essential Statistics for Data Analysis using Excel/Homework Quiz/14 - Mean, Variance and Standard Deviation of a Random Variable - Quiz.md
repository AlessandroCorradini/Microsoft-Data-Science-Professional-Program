### Discrete1

The current price of a company’s stock is $20. The company is a takeover target. If the takeover is successful, the company’s stock price will increase to $30. If the takeover is unsuccessful, the stock price will drop to $12.

Determine the range of values for the probability of a successful takeover that would make it worthwhile to purchase the stock today. Assume your goal is to maximize your expected profit.

- p > 3/9
- **p > 4/9**
- p > 5/9
- p > 6/9

### Discrete2

When a roulette wheel is spun, the possible outcomes are 0, 00, 1, 2, …, 36. If you bet on a number coming up, you win $35 if your number comes up and you lose $1 otherwise.

What is the mean and standard deviation of your winnings on a single play of the game?

- **m = -0.053, stddev = 5.8**
- m = -0.055, stddev = 6.0
- m = 0.053, stddev = 5.8
- m = 0.055, stddev = 6.0

## #Discrete3

A stock currently sells for $40. In the next month, there is a 60% chance the stock price will double and a 40% chance the stock will drop 50%. In a month, you will sell the stock.

Find the mean and standard deviation of your profit (in dollars).

- m = $15.00, stddev = $29.15
- **m = $16.00, stddev = $29.39**
- m = $17.00, stddev = $29.50
- m = $18.00, stddev = $29.79

### Discrete4

Suppose you bet on an odd number coming up in roulette. If an odd number comes up, you win $1, and if an odd number does not come up, you lose $1.

Find the mean and standard deviation of your profit.

- m = 0.053, stddev = 0.999
- m = 0.063, stddev = 0.899
- **m = -0.053, stddev = 0.999**
- m = -0.063, stddev = 0.899
