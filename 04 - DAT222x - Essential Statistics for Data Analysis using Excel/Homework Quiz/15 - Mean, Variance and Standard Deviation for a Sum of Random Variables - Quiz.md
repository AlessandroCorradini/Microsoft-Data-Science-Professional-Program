### Sum1

You toss two dice fifty times. Find the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the total number of dots showing.

Mean:

- 300
- 325
- **350**
- 375

Variance:

- 290
- **291**
- 292
- 293

Standard Deviation:

- 17.00
- 17.02
- 17.04
- **17.06**

### Sum2

The average number of births each day in Gotham City Hospital is 6 with a standard deviation of 3. In a 30 day month determine the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the total number of births.

The mean calculation requires the assumption that each day's births follow same random variable; no independnece needed.

Mean:

- **180**
- 185
- 190
- 195

The variance and standard deviation calculations require the assumption that births on each day follow identical independent random variables.

Variance:

- 265
- **270**
- 275
- 280

Standard Deviation:

- 16.41
- **16.43**
- 16.45
- 16.47

### Sum3

Assume the stock market is open 252 days each year. Assume the annual standard deviation of the percentage return on the DOW JONES INDEX is 20%.

Estimate the standard deviation of the daily return on the DOW.

- 0.0125
- **0.0126**
- 0.0127
- 0.0128

- Win $6.25
- Lose $6.25

Variance:

- 3.3208
- 33.208
- 332.08
- **3320.8**
