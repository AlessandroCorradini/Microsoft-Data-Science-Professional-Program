- **No**

### ZScores3

When teachers grade on a curve they often use z-scores to determine grade cutoffs. Suppose in Class 1 the mean score equals 70 and standard deviation equals 10. Assume a z-score of greater than or equal to 1.5 receives an A grade. In Class 2 the mean score equals 75 and standard deviation equals 8.

What should be the cutoff for an A in Class 2?

- 83
- 85

This question uses the dataset in ZScoresHW.xlsx. The dataset gives the Yards per Pass Attempt (Y/A) and Touchdown (TD) passes for NFL quarterbacks in the 2016 season.

Which is more impressive? Drew Brees' 7.8 Y/A or Philip Rivers' 31 TD passes?

- 7.8 Y/A
- **31 TD**

### ZScores5

If we doubled every player's TD passes what would happen to the z-scores for TD passes?

- **Z-scores stay the same**
- Z-scores decrease by 50%
- Z-scores increase by 50%
- Z-scores double
