# Populations and Samples

Please answer the following questions. Be sure that you have downloaded the associated Excel file before beginning the homework. This lesson uses the PopulationSamplesHW.xlsx file and has four problems.

Remember that homework counts for 10% of your final grade. You are allowed unlimited attempts per question for homework problems. The main goal of homework is for you to practice and learn how to apply what you've learned in the content without worrying about getting the problem right the first time. Some homework problems may also provide hints or advice. Have fun!

### Populations1

Suppose that a web survey on ESPN.com asks if male and female professional soccer players should be paid the same salary. 77% of those answering said No.

Would you think this result reflects the opinion of the general population?

- The sampling plan is not biased.
- Response bias
- **Selection bias**
- Publication bias

### Populations2

During 2016 Survey Monkey and NBC set up web surveys to determine the voter preferences of voters in each state. Suppose 10,000 voters responded in each state.

Why would the voter preferences from the survey not necessarily reflect the voter preferences of all voters in the state?

- The sampling plan is not biased.
- **Response bias**
- Selection bias
- Publication bias

How might you overcome this problem and get an accurate estimate of the voter preferences in each state?

- 1000 voter simple random sample
- **1500 voter simple random sample**
- 20000 participant web survey
- 30000 participant web survey

### Populations3

A study showed that a lower percentage of cats who fell from six stories or less survived than cats who fell from more than six stories. The results were based on visits to vet's offices.

What is the flaw in this study?

- The sampling plan is not biased.
- Response bias
- Selection bias
- **Survivorship bias**

### Populations4

Clinical trials which indicate a new drug is better than an older drug are twice as likely to be published than studies that indicate the new drug is no better.

This is an example of which type of bias?

- **Publication bias**
- Response bias
- Selection bias
- Survivorship bias
