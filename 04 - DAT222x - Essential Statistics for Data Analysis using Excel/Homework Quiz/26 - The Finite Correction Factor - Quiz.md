The main goal of homework is for you to practice and learn how to apply what you've learned in the content without worrying about getting the problem right the first time. Some homework problems may also provide hints or advice. Have fun!

### Finite1

In a local election poll in a town with 5000 registered voters how many voters need to be sampled so we can be 95% sure that we can estimate within 2% the true percentage of voters preferring the Democratic candidate? Apply the finite correction factor to your answer.

- 1612
- **1622**
- 1632
- 1642

### Finite2

In a batch of 200 soda cans how many many soda cans need to be sampled in order to be 95% sure that your estimate of the average number of ounces in a soda can is accurate within 0.03 ounces? Assume standard deviation of ounces in a can is 0.15 ounce. Apply the finite correction factor to your answer.

### Finite3

You are told the standard deviation of the invoice size in a population of 200 invoice values is $1,000. A sample of 50 invoices yields an average invoice size of $5,000. You are 95% sure that the average size of an invoice is between ____ and ____. Calculate the lower and upper limit and apply the finite correction factor to your answer. Enter the lower and upper limit to two (2) decimal places.

Lower limit

Upper limit
