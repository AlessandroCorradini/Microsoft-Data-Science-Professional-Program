# Type I and Type II Error - Quiz

Please answer the following questions. Be sure that you have downloaded the associated Excel file before beginning the homework. This lesson uses the TypeHW.xlsx file and has four problems. For each situation shown below describe the Type I and Type II error and the form of the critical region. Answers and explanations can be found in the TypeKEY.xlsx file as needed.

Remember that homework counts for 10% of your final grade. You are allowed unlimited attempts per question for homework problems. The main goal of homework is for you to practice and learn how to apply what you've learned in the content without worrying about getting the problem right the first time. Some homework problems may also provide hints or advice. Have fun!

### Type1

Suppose you want to determine if an Ebola vaccine is effective. In the previous lesson, you set up an appropriate null and alternative hypothesis and determinded the type of hypothesis. Now, describe the Type I and Type II error and the form of the critical region.

If we conclude the vaccine is not effective when it is actually effective, we have:

- Made a Type I error.
- **Made a Type II error.**
- Made a correct decision

### Type2

A new vendor supplying us with cell phone chips needs to prove to us that they are producing at most 0.1% defective chips. In the previous lesson, you set up an appropriate null and alternative hypothesis and determinded the type of hypothesis. Now, describe the Type I and Type II error and the form of the critical region.

If we conclude the chips produced are acceptable when they are not, we have:

- **Made a Type I error.**
- Made a Type II error.
- Made a correct decision

### Type3

You want to determine if the average home price in Katy, Texas is different than the average home price in Spring, Texas. In the previous lesson, you set up an appropriate null and alternative hypothesis and determinded the type of hypothesis. Now, describe the Type I and Type II error and the form of the critical region.

If we conclude mean home prices in the two cities are the same when they are actually different, we have:

- Made a Type I error.
- **Made a Type II error.**
- Made a correct decision

### Type4

You have been assigned to determine if 4th graders in Fargo, North Dakota are spending more than 1 hour per night on homework. In the previous lesson, you set up an appropriate null and alternative hypothesis and determinded the type of hypothesis. Now, describe the Type I and Type II error and the form of the critical region.

If we conclude students are spending average of more than 1 hour per night when they actually are not, we have:

- **Made a Type I error.**
- Made a Type II error.
- Made a correct decision
