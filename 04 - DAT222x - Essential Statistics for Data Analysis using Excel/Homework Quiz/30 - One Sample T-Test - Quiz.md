### TTest1

The average test score in the state of Texas is 75. A sample of 25 Dylan High School students yielded xbar = 74 and s = 5. For α = 0.05 would you conclude that Dylan students score significantly different than the state of Texas? What p-value would you report?

What do you conclude?

- **We accept Ho, the p-value is 0.3273**
- We accept Ho, the p-value is 1.3273
- We reject Ho, the p-value is 0.3273
- We reject Ho, the p-value is 1.3273

### TTest2

Suppose a can of soda is supposed to contain 12 oz. of soda. A random sample of 10 cans taken by the state of Washington yields xbar = 11.9 and s = 0.2 ounces. For α = 0.01 should the state conclude that soda cans are underfilled? What p-value would you report?

What do you conclude?

- **We accept Ho, the p-value is 0.0743**
- We accept Ho, the p-value is 1.0743
- We reject Ho, the p-value is 0.0743
- We reject Ho, the p-value is 1.0743

### TTest3

During the last year the average daily score customers calling a hot line gave customer support reps was 7.6. The company then gave all 36 reps a one month training program. During the next 15 days the support line was open, the average daily score customers gave was 8.0 with the standard deviation of the daily average scores was 0.7. For α = 0.05 would you conclude the training program improved customer satisfaction? What p-value would you report?

What do you conclude?

- We accept Ho, the p-value is 0.0221
- We accept Ho, the p-value is 1.0221
- **We reject Ho, the p-value is 0.0221**
- We reject Ho, the p-value is 1.0221

### TTest4

The current version of the XOXO tire average lasts 40,000 miles before wearing out. The tire has been redesigned and 20 tires were tested and the number of miles the tires lasted had xbar = 41,000 and s = 2,000. Would you conclude for α = 0.10 that the redesign has improved tire life? What p-value would you report?

What do you conclude?

- We accept Ho, the p-value is 0.0186
- We accept Ho, the p-value is 1.0186
- **We reject Ho, the p-value is 0.0186**
- We reject Ho, the p-value is 1.0186
