### Proportion1

A new vendor supplying us with cell phone chips needs to prove to us that they are producing at most 1% defective chips. Set up appropriate null and alternative hypotheses. In a sample of 500 chips from a large population suppose 10 were defective. For α = 0.05 would you accept the null hypothesis that the new vendor's chips contain at most 1% defective chips?

What do you conclude?

- We accept Ho, the p-value is 0.0311
- We accept Ho, the p-value is 1.0311
- **We reject Ho, the p-value is 0.0311**
- We reject Ho, the p-value is 1.0311

### Proportion2

A basketball player has a long history of making 70% of his free throws. Early this season she has made 180 of 300 free throws. Does this provide sufficent evidence (for α=0.05) that the player's free throw shooting ability has changed?

What do you conclude?

- We accept Ho, the p-value is 0.0003, the shooting ability has not changed
- We accept Ho, the p-value is 1.0003, the shooting ability has not changed
- **We reject Ho, the p-value is 0.0003, the shooting ability has changed**
- We reject Ho, the p-value is 1.0003, the shooting ability has changed

### Proportion3

In the past 85% of all customers calling a customer support line have been satisfied with their service. We have just given all support employees a one month training course that we hope improves customer satisfaction. In the first month after the trianing course 185 of 200 customers were satisfied with their service. For α = 0.05, does this provide sufficient evidence that the training course has improved service?

What do you conclude?

- We accept Ho, the p-value is 0.0010, service has not improved
- We accept Ho, the p-value is 1.0010, service has not improved
- **We reject Ho, the p-value is 0.0010, service has improved**
- We reject Ho, the p-value is 1.0010, service has improved
