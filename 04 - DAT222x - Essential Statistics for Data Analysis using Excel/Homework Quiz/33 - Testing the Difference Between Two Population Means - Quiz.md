Remember that homework counts for 10% of your final grade. You are allowed unlimited attempts per question for homework problems. The main goal of homework is for you to practice and learn how to apply what you've learned in the content without worrying about getting the problem right the first time. Some homework problems may also provide hints or advice. Have fun!

### TwoPopulations1

Use the given data on annual Tbills and 10 year Bond returns to determine if Tbills and Bond10 returns have equal means. Use α = 0.05. You cannot assume the returns in each row are from the same year.

- **Means are equal**
- Means are NOT equal

### TwoPopulations2

You are given the total number of blocked shots and steals for 14 college basketball teams during 4 games. Determine if a team has significantly more steals than block shots. Use α = 0.01. Note the data in each row gives the blocked shots and steals for the same team. Assume the number of block shots and steals both follow a normal random variable.

- **p-value is less than or equal to 0.001 and we reject the null hypothesis**
- p-value is greater than 0.001 and we reject the null hypothesis

### TwoPopulations3

You are given the amount of money spent at a supermarket by a sample of shoppers during the morning and afternoon hours. For α = 0.05 does this data indicate that morning shoppers spend less than afternoon shoppers?

- **p-value is 0.01 so conclude average spent by morning customers is less than average spent by afternoon customers**
- p-value is 0.10 so conclude average spent by morning customers is greater than average spent by afternoon customers

### TwoPopulations4

You are given the miles per gallon obtained for 20 cars using gasoline and ethanol. For α = 0.01, does this data indicate that there is a significant difference in the MPG cars obtain when fueled by ethanol or gasoline?

- p-value is 0.0082 so reject that average mileage does not depend on whether gas or ethanol is used
- **P-value is 0.8200 so accept that average mileage does not depend on whether gas or ethanol is used**
