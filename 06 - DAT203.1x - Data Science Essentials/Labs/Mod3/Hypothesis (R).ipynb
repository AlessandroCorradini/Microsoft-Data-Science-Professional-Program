Hypothesis testing is widely used. Anytime you are trying to determine if a parameter or relationship is statistically significant you can perform a hypothesis test. \n\nIn this lab you will explore and perform hypothesis tests on a famous data set collect by Frances Galton, who invented the regression method. Galton collected these data from Families living in late 19th century London.  Galton published his famous paper in 1885, showing that the highs of adult children regressed to the mean of the population, regardless of the heights of the parents. From this seminal study we have the term regression in statistics, ", "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": "## Exercise 1.

In hypothesis testing the a null hypothesis is tested against a statistic. The null hypothesis is simply that the difference is not significant. Depending on the value of the test statistic, you can accept or reject the null hypthesis. \n\nIn this case, you will use the two-sided t-test to determine if the difference in means of two variables are significantly different.   The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the means. There are multiple criteria which are used to interpret the test results. You will determine if you can reject the null hyposesis based on the following criteria:\n\n- Selecting a **confidence level** of **5%** or **0.05**.\n- Determine if the t-statistic for the degrees of freedom is greater than the **critical value**. The difference in means of Normally distributed variables follows a t-distribution. The large t-statistic indicates the probility that the difference in means is unlikely to be by chance alone. \n- Determine if the P-value is less than the **confidence level**. A small P-value indicates the probability of the difference of the means being more extreme by chance alone is the small. \n- The **confidence interval** around the difference of the means does not overlap with **0**. If the **confidence interval** is far from **0** this indicates that the difference in means is unlikely to include **0**. \n\nBased on these criteria you will accept of reject the null hypothesis. However, rejecting the null-hypothesis should not be confused with accepting the alternative. It simply means the null is not a good hypothesis. \n\nThe **family.test** function in the cell below uses the base R **t.test** function to compute the two-sided t statistics.
