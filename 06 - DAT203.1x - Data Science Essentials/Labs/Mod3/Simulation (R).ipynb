Simulation is widely used in cases where estimates are required from complex distributions of values or a hierarchy of distributions. \nIn this lab you will estimate the range of expected profitability for a lemonade stand. The profitability of the lemonade stand depends on the number of customers arriving, the profit from the drinks they order, and the tips the customer may or may not choose to leave. The distribution of possible profits is thus, the joint distribution of customer arrivals, items ordered, and tips. In practice, such a complex distribution cannot be analyzed except using simulation."}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "## Exercise 1: Computing Random Variables\nR offers comprehensive support for computing random variables from probability distributions.
