Data scientists spend a lot of time working to undertand the relationships in and data set (**data exporation**).\n\nIn these lessons we will be working with a data set containing the prices and characteristics of a number of automobiles. The ultimate goal is to build a model for predicting the price of a car from its characteristics. However, in this lesson we will focus on data exploration using visualization techniques. \n\nThese lessons are divided into several parts. In each part you will learn how to use the visualization tools availble in R.\n\n- **Overview of ggplot2** the package we will use extensively in this course for plotting. \n- **Overview of plot types** is a reivew of creating basic plot types used to construct visualizations.\n- **Using Aesthetics** is an overview of how to project additional plot dimensions using plot aesthetics.\n- **Facetted plotting** also know as conditioned plotting or lattice plotting introduces a powerful method for visualizing higher dimensional data.

Visualization is a key first step in the exploration of most data sets. As a general rule, you should never start creating models until you have examined the data and understand the relationships. Otherwise, you risk wasting your time creating models blindly. Visualization is also a powerful tool for presentation of results and for determining sources of problems with analytics. \n\nThe concepts of exploring a data set visually were pioneered by John Tukey in the 1960s and 1970s. Tukey consolidated his many ideas on data exploration into a book in the late 1970s, ***John Tukey, Exploratory Data Analysis, 1977, Addison-Westley***.\n\nBill Cleveland documented his seminal work in visualization of complex data sets in his book, ***William S. Cleveland, Visualizing Data, 1993, Hobart Press***.\n\nThe key concept of exploratory data analysis (EDA) or visual exploration of data is to understand the relationships in the data set. Specifically using visualization when you approach a new data set you can:\n\n- Explore complex data sets, using visualization to develop understanding of the inherent relationships.\n- Use different chart types to create multiple views of data to highlight different aspects of the inherent relationships.\n- Use plot aesthetics to project multiple dimensions. \n- Apply conditioning or faceting methods to project multiple dimensions\n\n\n", "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": "### Basic chart types\n\nNow that we have loaded and had a first look at the data, let's get to work making some charts. \n\nThere are enumerable chart types that are used for data exploration.

We have learned quite a bit about the relationships in the auto price data set by creating multiple views to visualize these data. \n\nSpecifically, in this tutoral we have:\n\n- Examined the uses of and methods for creation of several basic plot types.\n- Used plot aesthetics to project additional dimensions onto a two dimensional plot surface, or to highlight aspects of the relationships in the data.\n- Used multi-axis and faceted plots to project additional dimensions onto the two dimensional plot surface. \n\nFinally, **have fun exploring your data!**", "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"outputs": [], "metadata": {"collapsed": true}, "execution_count": null, "source": "", "cell_type": "code"}], "metadata": {"language_info": {"mimetype": "text/x-r-source", "file_extension": ".r", "name": "R", "codemirror_mode": "r", "version": "3.1.1", "pygments_lexer": "r"}, "anaconda-cloud": {}, "kernelspec": {"display_name": "R", "language": "R", "name": "r"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
