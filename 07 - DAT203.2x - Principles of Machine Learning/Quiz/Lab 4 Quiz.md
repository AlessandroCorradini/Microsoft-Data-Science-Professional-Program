### Boosted Classification

In the lab, you compared the performance of the original logistical regression classification model, and a boosted decision trees model.

Which of the following ROC charts shows the original logistical regression model as the scored dataset, and the boosted decision trees model as the scored dataset to compare?

### Decision Forest Regression

In the lab, you created a decision forest regression model for the bike rental dataset, and compared its performance with that of the original linear regression model.

What conclusion can you reach about the two regression models?

- The linear regression model performs best for the bike rental dataset.
- **The decision forest regression model performs best for the bike rental dataset.**
- Linear regression models always produce a lower root mean squared error than decision forest regression models.
- Linear regression models always produce a higher root mean squared error than decision forest regression models.
