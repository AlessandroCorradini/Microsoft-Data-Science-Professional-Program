# Quiz 14 - Clustering

### Review Question 1

Only one of following statements is true. Which one is it?

- **Its possible for samples from two different clusters to be more similar to one another than their intra-cluster neighbors, if the the two clusters are large and located near one another**
- Real world data typically comes labeled
- Unsupervised clustering aims to group your samples based on their labels
- Centroids are records that live in your dataset and share the same feature space so that a meaningful distance can be calculated between them and your samples

### Review Question 2

Once again, only a single one of the following statements is correct. Do you know which one it is?

- It's possible for a sample to be assigned to two clusters; but only if its equidistant from either cluster.
- The K-Means algorithm scans your dataset to detect clusters using an iterative assignment / update cycle. The algorithm returns the number of clusters found, as well as their centroid position.
- As a clustering algorithm, K-Means is really only useful for grouping your samples
- **K-Means assumes your features are either length normalized, or that their length encodes a specific meaning.**
