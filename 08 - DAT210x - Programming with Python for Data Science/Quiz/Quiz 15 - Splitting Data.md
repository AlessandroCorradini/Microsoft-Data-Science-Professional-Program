# Quiz 15 - Splitting Data

### Review Question 1

One of the following statements is actually a lie. Select the statement that is inaccurate from the list below:

- **Overfitting means your machine learning algorithm is performing at 100% and has been over trained**
- In supervised learning, you provide the algorithm the correct answers while training it
- If you split off too many samples for testing, your training is going to suffer as a consequence
- There shouldn't be an overlap in your training and testing dataset, because your algorithm already has the answers to the training data

### Review Question 2

What of these demonstrates the proper order of operations?

- Load Data, Encode Data / Wrangle Data, KMeans the Data, Split Data
- **Load Data, Encode Data / Wrangle Data, Split Data, Fit PCA with Training Data**
- Load Data, Encode Data / Wrangle Data, PCA the Data, Split Data
- Load Data, Encode Data / Wrangle Data, Split Data, Fit Isomap with Testing Data
- Load Data, Encode Data / Wrangle Data, Isomap the Data, Split Data

### Review Question 3

Overfitting is best described as:

- **Your machine learning model not generalizing well against new data**
- What happens when you don't split your data too much
- Training your machine learning algorithms until they have a high level of accuracy
- Working out more than necessary
