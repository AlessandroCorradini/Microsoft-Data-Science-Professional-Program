# Quiz 19 - Dewcision Trees

### Review Question 1

Please mark the appropriate response below:

- Decision trees are able to do non-linear classification because the tree branches don't use linear decision surfaces
- Each node of the tree represents the outcome of decision, such as age > 18, leading to an eventual classification
- The decision tree algorithm is able to build a tree based on the intrinsic geometry of your dataset
- **Decision trees do not use kernels, but are capable of doing non-linear classification by segmenting your feature-space.**

### Review Question 2

Which of the following scenarios would you use decision trees to solve?

- **You want to build a model for your interns to use, for segmenting customers based on their reply to survey questions.**
- You want to discover which customers are more similar, for the purposes of targeted advertising.
- Given a dataset of star masses and locations, you're interested in calculating the position of a galactic black hole.
- Given pressure, temperature, and height above sea-level samples, you're interested in modeling the amount of oxygen present in the air.
