# Quiz 2 - Machine Learning

### Review Question 1

What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?

- With unsupervised learning, it's up to you if you'd like to observe the computer train against data.
- Difference? There is no difference.
- **Unsupervised learning attempts to extract patterns; supervised learning tries to fit rules and equations.**
- With supervised learning, it's possible to watch the computer train against data samples.

### Review Question 2
