# Quiz 22 - Cross Validation

### Review Question 1

If a rocket ship's navigation computer needs to classify asteroids to avoid them...

- True positives are the most harmful, because an android will certainly strike the ship.
- True negatives are the most harmful, because the model failed to classify the asteroid, causing it to strike the ship.
- False positives are the most harmful, because the model got confused resulting in the ship getting struck.
- **False negatives are the most harmful, because the model didn't tell the ship to dodge the asteroid.**

### Review Question 2

Here are a couple of definitions; the name of these techniques have been withheld:

1. A technique that divides all samples into k-groups, ideally each having all samples except one.
2. A technique that divides all samples into k-groups, ideally of equal size.
3. A technique that divides all samples into k-groups, ideally each group having the same proportion of target classes.
4. A technique that divides all samples into k-groups, ideally the same target never appearing in both testing and training groups simultaneously.

Pick the option below corresponding to the ordered definitions above:
