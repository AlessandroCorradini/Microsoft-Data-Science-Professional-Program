# Quiz Determining Features

### Review Question 1

The best features are...

- Your raw data
- Those that are highly correlated
- Those with the most variance
- Those with the least variance
- **Those pertaining to the task you're trying to solve**

### Review Question 2

Given a dataset with many features, consisting of patient medical records, let's say you want to trim it down to only those features that are related to patient allergies. Which one of the following features is least likely to be statistically relevant to a person's allergies?

- Patient Drug Prescriptions
- **Patient Eye Color**

- Patient Environment

### Review Question 3

When building out your dataset initially, what are the three things should you focus on the most?

- Collecting more features than samples, so that each observation is documented in great detail.
- **Collecting more samples than features, so that the mathematics required for machine learning works out well.**
- **Collecting features, even if independently they don't do a great job at answering your dataset's question.**
- Ensure you only collect features that directly answer your question without ambiguity.
- **Let your intuition about the question, and expertise in the domain of your issue, drive you to choosing right features.**
